	abstract = {Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service with millions of members and growing at a tremendous rate. With the buzz surrounding the service have come claims of its ability to transform the way people interact and share information and calls for public figures to start using the service. In this study, we are interested in the type of content that legislators are posting to the service, particularly by members of the United States Congress. We read and analyzed the content of over 6,000 posts from all members of Congress using the site. Our analysis shows that Congresspeople are primarily using Twitter to disperse information, particularly links to news articles about themselves and to their blog posts, and to report on their daily activities. These tend not to provide new insights into government or the legislative process or to improve transparency; rather, they are vehicles for self-promotion. However, Twitter is also facilitating direct communication between Congresspeople and citizens, though this is a less popular activity. We report on our findings and analysis and discuss other uses of Twitter for legislators.},

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that political leanings correlate with various psychological factors. While surveys and experiments provide a rich source of information for political psychology, data from social networks can offer more naturalistic and robust material for analysis. This research investigates psychological differences between individuals of different political orientations on a social networking platform, Twitter. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that the language used by liberals emphasizes their perception of uniqueness, contains more swear words, more anxiety-related words and more feeling-related words than conservatives’ language. Conversely, we predicted that the language of conservatives emphasizes group membership and contains more references to achievement and religion than liberals’ language. We analysed Twitter timelines of 5,373 followers of three Twitter accounts of the American Democratic and 5,386 followers of three accounts of the Republican parties’ Congressional Organizations. The results support most of the predictions and previous findings, confirming that Twitter behaviour offers valid insights to offline behaviour.},

We also discuss challenges and risks associated with using social media as a platform for scaling up. Our analysis suggests that while benefits of social media use outweigh its risks, careful management of online media platforms is necessary to mitigate concrete, physical risks that social media can create for activists.},

We find evidence of a model of social media efficacy in which BLM predicts mainstream news coverage of police brutality, which in turn is the strongest driver of attention to the issue from political elites.

	abstract = {Twitter allows political candidates to broadcast messages directly to the public, some of which spread virally, potentially reaching new supportive audiences. During the 2014 U.S. gubernatorial election, 74 candidates for State Governor posted 20,580 tweets, of which 10,946 were retweeted almost 140,000 times. By analyzing a collection of tweets posted by gubernatorial candidates that were classified by machine learning into categories of message types, we find that while candidates tend to post tweets that advocate for themselves the most, the public is more likely to retweet attack messages and messages labeled as call-to-action. As measured by number of retweets, call-to-action tweets tend to reach the broadest audience. We also find that middle-level gatekeepers, those with between 1,800 and 26,000 followers, tend to have the most influence over the flow of political information. Since retweets tend to bring new followers, these findings suggest that politicians wishing to grow their audience may benefit from posting more call-to-action and attack messages, and that candidates may wish to find ways to actively enlist the support of middle-level gatekeepers.},

	shorttitle = {Navigating the political labyrinth},
	abstract = {After the struggle for women’s right to vote in the United States ended in 1920, many feminists hoped women would achieve equality in U.S. elective office. Yet, even with the increase of women in the workforce and the 1960s women’s movement, these dreams did not materialize. Even the so-called Year of the Woman in 1992 did not result in a federal legislature near parity. Not only has women’s underrepresentation persisted at all levels—from the U.S. Congress to mayoral offices and city councils—it also has plateaued. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of women holding seats in the U.S. Senate increased by 7 and only 25 additional women won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, constituting a mere 19.5\% of U.S. Congress as a whole (Center for American Women and Politics, 2015). A labyrinth—a complex maze with high walls, obstacles, and unclear paths to an exit—is a particularly apt metaphor to describe women’s professional journeys (Eagly \& Carli, 2007). Seeking electoral office is one path through this maze, with winning one way to achieve success in the labyrinth. There are many individual and social structural factors that open and close paths to success in the labyrinth. We highlight how one factor—prejudice from key political actors, such as voters, party elites, and potential candidates—constitutes a roadblock for women. We begin with the significance of studying women’s quest for electoral success by establishing the necessity of women in office for the representation of women’s interests. After defining prejudice, we apply principles from role congruity theory (RCT) to hypothesize why political actors might have prejudiced reactions toward female candidates. At first glance, however, much extant evidence falls short of implicating prejudice. We therefore identify temporal, structural (e.g., level of office), contextual (e.g., campaign issues and behavior), and intersectional identity (e.g., party) conditions as moderators to the occurrence of prejudice. Organizing the literature according to these moderators reveals evidence of when prejudice occurs (and does not occur). For instance, we demonstrate how prejudice toward female candidates increases in war time, as opposed to during a domestic crisis. We argue that more research could better illuminate the intersection of factors that are most likely to give rise to the prejudice that blocks women’s electoral success and contributes to the underrepresentation of women in U.S. politics.

In contrast, Republicans not only discuss the issue far less, but also keep their terms more general, as well as criticizing perceived protest violence.},

While these processes imply dynamic connections among political actors, researchers often cannot observe such interdependence. One example is public policy diffusion, which has long been a focus of multiple subfields. In the American state politics context, diffusion is commonly conceptualized as a dyadic process whereby states adopt policies (in part) because other states have adopted them. This implies a policy diffusion network connecting the states. Using a dataset of 187 policies, we introduce and apply an algorithm that infers this network from persistent diffusion patterns. The results contribute to knowledge on state policy diffusion in several respects. Additionally, in introducing network inference to political science, we provide scholars across the discipline with a general framework for empirically recovering the latent and dynamic interdependence among political actors.},

We use a unique survey of citizens? perceptions of other states to construct a national network of similarity ties between the states. We apply this new measure with a data set of state policy adoptions in a dyadic and monadic event history analysis and find that similar state adoptions are a reliable predictor of policy innovation. We argue that perceived state similarity is a more complete measure of how states look to each other than contiguity.},

	abstract = {Local policy adoptions provide an excellent opportunity to test among potential mechanisms of policy diffusion. By examining three types of antismoking policy choices by the 675 largest U.S. cities between 1975 and 2000, we uncover robust patterns of policy diffusion, yielding three key findings. First, we distinguish among and find evidence for four mechanisms of policy diffusion: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate cities, imitation of larger cities, and coercion by state governments. Second, we find a temporal component to these effects, with imitation being a more short-lived diffusion process than the others. Third, we show that these mechanisms are conditional, with larger cities being better able to learn from others, less fearful of economic spillovers, and less likely to rely on imitation.},
